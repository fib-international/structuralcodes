# Section
A section object is created starting with a defined `Geometry` (tipically a `SurfaceGeometry` or a `CompoundGeometry`). This object contains a `SectionCalculator` that is the responsible for doing structural computations on the section. These computations requires an integration across the secion, this integration is performed with the use of a `SectionIntegrator`.
